# Drugs-Consumption-Prediction-Model-Using-EDA-And-Bagging-Classifier

Drug consumption prediction models are like crystal balls for public health. By analyzing vast amounts of data, these models can identify individuals or communities at higher risk of drug use. They consider factors like demographics, social media activity, prescription history, and even economic indicators. The goal is to anticipate potential problems and intervene early with prevention programs, support services, or targeted outreach. While not perfect, these models can be a powerful tool for tackling the complex issue of drug use.
